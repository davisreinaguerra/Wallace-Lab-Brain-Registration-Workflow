# Wallace Lab Brain Registration Workflow

### Described here are instructions for collecting quantitative anatomical data for individual mouse brains.  Only one brain at a time should be run through this pipeline.

# Step 1: Slice your brain

### Collect slices at a regular interval

# Step 2: Mount brains

### if you are not immunostaining, be sure to use the protocol to permeabilize cells with PBST before giving them DAPI

# Step 3: Scan slides

### Make sure your images are not overexposed

# Step 4: Create a project in Qupath containing all the slices from a single brain

# Step 5: Register your brain slices with an atlas using ABBA

### We use the program Aligning Big Brains to Atlases (ABBA).  Instructions for use can be found here: https://biop.github.io/ijp-imagetoatlas/.
### 

# Step 6: Analyze your registered Images in Qupath
